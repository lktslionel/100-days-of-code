### Day 2: July 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 

**Thoughts:** Going back to the IP protocol fundamentals feels great. And learning, one more time things like network flow in the TCP/IP stack, routing protocol and DNS, make you more confident for future talk about these topics. These 2 chapters were focusing on theory; now I want to write some networking code :-p. Let's see what is int he next chapter.
