The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on July 05, Monday, 2021.

## Log

### R1D1 

I started working on Networking in Go. For the next few days, I will be reading and practicing what's inside the book from start to finish. Today, it was a refresh on networking fundamentals:

* Network topology
* OSI Model
* TCP/IP Model

### R1D2 

Going back to the IP protocol fundamentals feels great. And learning, one more time things like network flow in the TCP/IP stack, routing protocol and DNS, make you more confident for future talk about these topics. These 2 chapters were focusing on theory; now I want to write some networking code :-p. Let's see what is int he next chapter.
